<p align="center">
  <img src="public/sample.png" alt="Device" width="400"/>
</p>


**SensorStack** is a real-time environmental monitoring system that measures **temperature**, **humidity**, and **water level** using an **ESP32**, **DHT22 sensor**, and **analog water level sensor**. Data is displayed on a **16x2 I2C LCD** and sent to a **Blynk dashboard** for remote access. This project is perfect for **smart agriculture**, **environmental monitoring**, and **low-cost water systems**.

## üíª Software Setup

### 1. Install Required Libraries
- `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
- `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
- `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
- `Blynk` (Install Blynk Library v1.x for legacy or Blynk IoT Library for new platform)

### 2. Install the Blynk App
- Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/)
- Create a new project
- Choose **ESP32** as the board
- Add widgets:
  - **Value Displays** for Temp (¬∞C/¬∞F), Humidity, and Water Level
  - **Menu widget** or buttons to change LCD display modes (optional)
- Copy the **Auth Token** from the app

### 3. Code Setup
- Paste the Auth Token in your sketch
- Replace Wi-Fi SSID and password
- Use `Blynk.virtualWrite(Vx, value)` to send data to your widgets
- Upload the code using Arduino IDE

## üìä Usage Instructions

### LCD Display Modes

| Mode | Description               |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Temperature in ¬∞F         |
| 2    | Temperature in ¬∞C         |
| 3    | Humidity (%)              |
| 4    | Water Level (%)           |

Use a **Blynk menu widget** or **buttons** to change modes remotely. The display updates every 2 seconds.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Remote Monitoring via Blynk

With Blynk, you can:
- See real-time values on your smartphone
- Control which value is displayed on the LCD
- Set alerts for abnormal temperature/humidity or low water levels

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Likely Cause                       | Fix                                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| LCD not displaying text     | Wrong I2C address or bad wiring    | Try `0x3F` instead of `0x27`; check VCC/GND  |
| No sensor values shown      | Sensor not initialized or miswired | Check `Serial Monitor` for errors            |
| Blynk not connecting        | Wrong Auth Token or Wi-Fi issue    | Double-check credentials and signal strength |
| Water level stuck at 0/100%| Dry test or poor calibration       | Use real water; avoid testing with fingers   |

## üßº Maintenance

- Keep sensors clean and dust-free
- Ensure waterproofing for water sensor
- Restart ESP32 occasionally for Wi-Fi stability
- Secure all breadboard/jumper connections
